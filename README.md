# javascript-challenge

This project takes a small dataset of UFO sightings and displays it in an HTML table using javascript. The user may then input criteria (date in UFO-level-1 and date, city, state, country, and/or shape in UFO-level-2) which limit the table to only sightings that satisfy those conditions. 

To extend this project, the startsWith() and toLowerCase() methods were added to make the searchs more robust. Now, a state search of "C" will return all data from both co and ca.
